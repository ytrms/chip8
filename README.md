They say if you want to get into developing emulators, starting off with one for the Chip-8 "virtual computer" will get you on the right track.

So this is my first emulator (technically an interpreter) for the Chip-8 architecture.

I created it with no AI code at all, using the Raylib framework, just for the joy of programming. It's not perfect, but I just wanted to put something out there.

# Usage
`chip8 <path_to_rom>`
